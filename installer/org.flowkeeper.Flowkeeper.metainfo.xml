        <p>
            Flowkeeper is a Pomodoro timer with a &quot;classic&quot; cross-platform UI paradigm (desktop-first, no Electron). With its keyboard shortcuts and advanced settings, Flowkeeper is optimized for power users. It stays as close as possible to the Pomodoro Technique definition and format from the original book by Francesco Cirillo.
