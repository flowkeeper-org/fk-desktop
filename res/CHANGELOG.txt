### v1.0.2 (22 September 2025)

This version addresses a couple of new bugs, one of which is quite annoying:

- Can't void a pomodoro or record an interruption in non-latest backlogs (#199, #195).
- An occasional exception when waking up from sleep (#197).

### v1.0.1 (30 August 2025)

This version addresses all known bugs that we had in GitHub:

- Miscellaneous font issues (#136).
- Backlogs toggle icon doesn't change its color on theme change (#138).
- Voiding a pomodoro that has already finished (#149).
- Focus mode lost window title on Wayland (#152).

Also, Windows binaries are now compiled using Clang to reduce antivirus false positives.

### v1.0.0 (14 July 2025)

This version brings Flowkeeper even closer to the original Pomodoro Technique definition from Francesco Cirillo's book.
Pomodoro interruptions are now handled as the book prescribes, and we introduced support for long breaks. One major
deviation from the Technique in this version is the ability to track unfocused time. As usual there's a bunch of
miscellaneous quality-of-life improvements, bugfixes and better support for Linux.

New features:

- Tracking unfocused time -- try to start a work item with no pomodoros (#94, #98).
- Long breaks and working in series, see Settings > Series and breaks (#53).
- Dragging work items between backlogs (#60).
- Recording interruptions (#75).
- Voided pomodoros are displayed as ticks, and completed ones are crossed out to better match the Book (#41, #92).
- Import from CSV and GitHub, try Ctrl+I (#125).
- Hovering over pomodoros displays a detailed log of your work (#93).
- "Contact us" submenu to facilitate feedback collection (#111).
- Flowkeeper window now hides automatically on auto-start (#102).
- New font selector for macOS, which supports Apple system font (#113).
- Resting music starts playing from the right position if we restart Flowkeeper.

Technical improvements:

- Standard data and log directories on Linux, macOS and Windows (#65).
- Three new ways to get Flowkeeper:
 - Install it from Flathub (#63),
 - Install from OBS for openSUSE Tumbleweed (#127),
 - Download a portable AppImage from flowkeeper.org or GitHub Releases.
- Flowkeeper now supports Linux on arm64 / aarch64.
- Added support for Qt 6.8.x.
- A preview of Flowkeeper CLI is now available in the sources (#46).
- Ignoring own modifications when "watch changes" is enabled (#130).
- Improved technical documentation (#80, #87).
- Complete drag & drop rewrite to accommodate moving work items between backlogs.
- Flowkeeper binaries are now built using Nuitka in addition to PyInstaller (#114).
- Madelene music composition changed its format from mp3 to m4a/aac.
- Removed support for Ubuntu 20.04, as GitHub Actions deprecated it.

Bug fixes:

- Selecting directory as log file (#108).
- Window icon on Wayland (#110).
- Line breaks in work items and backlogs (#132).
- Changing audio devices while Flowkeeper is running (#120).
