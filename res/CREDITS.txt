We use Coverage.py by Ned Batchelder <https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/blob/master/NOTICE.txt> for collecting unit test coverage.

The build pipeline automatically uploads test coverage results to coveralls.io under its "Open Source" plan <https://coveralls.io/terms>.

To produce desktop binaries for Linux, macOS and Windows we use PyInstaller <https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme>.
